# ruby-pv

:construction: **WORK IN PROGRESS** :construction:

A handy progress monitor for long-running tasks. Like [`pv`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/pv), but for Ruby. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-pv'
```

And then execute:

    bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    gem install ruby-pv

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

### Printing to stdout while `pv`ing

It just works. Seamlessly. {insert Steve Jobs picture}

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in the `.gemspec` file, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and pudmsh the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
